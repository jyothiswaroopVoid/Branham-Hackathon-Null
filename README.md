# Branham-Hackathon-Null
# Demo App

This is an overview of your project, what it does and why you did it. This is your intro and should tell people why they use this project and what it is for.
We figured the numnber one problem with students nowadays is time management so we decided to tackle that problem in this hackathon
This project provides students with tools to help them better manage their time. 
With thorough research and accurate data we created the grade calculator, which calculates what your grade would be depending on how much effort you put into the subject.
We created a Test prep schedule which helps you calculate how much you should study everyday for the test.
Lastly we created flashcards which help the students memorize key topics.

## How to Use

This should include how to actually use your project. Is there a process you need to use to build it? How is it deployed. After reading this section I should be able to download this file and have easy steps to follow to get the project to run.
## How it Works

We built a sophisticated code but quite simple user interface. The user needs an IDE or something that can run a java program. 
They will copy and paste the code into the program and look into the console. The console while guilde them through three of our tools
This should include how your project works, what makes this project possible?

### Technology
What tools where used to make this project? What language, library's, frameworks, ideas ect. Give credit to the tools, you can always link them like `[text for link](https://demolink.com/demo)`.

We used the language Java and programmed through an IDE called Eclipse

### File Structure

Give a basic example of how your files are organized and what goes where. What are the key files that an outside observer needs to know about?
We have various methods to organize our data within the class, the user doesn't need to know any of that though.
### Problems

Explain some major problems that you faced and overcame. Explain what allowed you to overcome these issues and continue working on the project.
Our major problem was how to make a website or app using Java, but their weren't any realistic approaches and some needed money so we didn't go down that path.
Rather we thought to keep it simple, and effiecient.

## Other (optional)

This has other stuff that you want to tell us. This entire section is optional.

### Issues

Explain anything that currently is broken or doesnt work properly.

### Future Improvements
